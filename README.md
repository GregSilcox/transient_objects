# Transient Objects [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/GregSilcox/transient_objects.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/GregSilcox/transient_objects)

Transient objects is a set of non-persitent objects that support persistent object, i.e. those with database tables. It also supports controllers, views, printing, emailing, etc. Because there are no persistent objects, there is no need to migrate a database, making testing very fast.
